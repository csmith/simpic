image::resources/banner.png[Simpic]

Simpic is a simple picture hosting service, effectively a slimmed down and self-hosted alternative to Google Photos.

== Feature status

Simpic is currently pre-MVP. Unless you want to help develop it, there's probably not much here for you yet.
You can see planned features in the https://github.com/simpicapp/simpic/issues[issue tracker].

== Running

The simplest and easiest approach to running Simpic is to use Docker. You can use the example
docker-compose.yml file in this repository to quickly build footnote:[Eventually Simpic will
be published to Docker Hub and you'll be able to pull the image from there instead of
building yourself.] and start an instance of Simpic alongside its own Postgres server.

Assuming you have https://docs.docker.com/install/[installed docker]
and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose], all you need to do is:

----
docker-compose up -d
----

And then Simpic will be accessible on port 8080.

=== Configuration

Simpic is configured using environment variables.
It currently has the following options:

[%header,cols="m,m,3"]
|===
|Env var|Default|Description

| SIMPIC_CREATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD
| -
.2+^.^| If both are specified, a new admin account with those credentials will be created.

| SIMPIC_CREATE_ADMIN_USERNAME
| -

| SIMPIC_DATABASE_DEBUG
| false
| Enables verbose logging of SQL queries.

| SIMPIC_DSN
| -
| The 'data source name' to use to connect to the Postgres database. See:
  https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lib/pq?tab=doc#hdr-Connection_String_Parameters[list of all valid parameters].

| SIMPIC_FRONTEND
| dist
| File system path to serve the compiled frontend files from.

| SIMPIC_MIGRATIONS
| migrations
| File system path to the database migration files.

| SIMPIC_PATH
| data
| File system path to store image and thumbnail data.

| SIMPIC_PORT
| 8080
| TCP port to listen on for requests.

| SIMPIC_SECURE_COOKIES
| true
| Whether to mark cookies as HTTPS-only or not.

| SIMPIC_SESSION_EXPIRY
| 774h (31 days)
| Length of time that users stay logged in for. Specified in hours/minutes/etc, e.g. "3h30m".
|===

== Developing

The docker-compose.dev.yml file in this repository contains a simple postgres service
that is exposed on localhost:5432, and a service to live rebuild the JavaScript frontend
that exposes a websocket endpoint on localhost:8081.

With these two running, you can run Simpic as a normal Go binary with the following env
var to use the local postgres server:

----
SIMPIC_DSN=user=simpic dbname=simpic password=nWK9aY9gkh sslmode=disable
----

The frontend will then automatically rebuild and reload in response to changes to the
source.

== Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
